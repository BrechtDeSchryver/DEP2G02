### Web Application

#### Setup

1. Start the backend API service by using the command `node index.js` in `/api` (Make sure all libs from [requirements.txt](api\requirements.txt) are installed)
2. Run index.html on localhost. Just opening it in the browser won't work. If you use Visual Studio Code, you can use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer "Extension page") extension.
